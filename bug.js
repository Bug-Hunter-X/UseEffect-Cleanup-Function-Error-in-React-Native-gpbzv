This error occurs when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with a cleanup function that throws an error.  The error might not be immediately obvious because it's not directly related to the component's rendering.  It often surfaces when you're working with asynchronous operations like network requests or subscriptions that are cancelled prematurely.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const subscription = someAsyncOperation().subscribe(data => {});

  return () => {
    // Error occurs here if someAsyncOperation is already unmounted
    subscription.unsubscribe(); // Throws an error if subscription is already unmounted
  };
}, []);
```
